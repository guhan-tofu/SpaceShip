# SpaceShip

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic SpaceShip using machine learning algorithms. The SpaceShip dataset contains information about passengers, such as age, gender, cabin, and homeplanet, and whether they arrived at their destination or not.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of two main files:

train.csv: Contains training data with features and survival labels.
test.csv: Contains evaluation data with features but without survival labels.
The preprocessing steps applied to the dataset include:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Scaling numerical features


## Data Exploration
During the exploration phase, key findings include:

Distribution of passenger age, fare, and other features
Relationship between features and survival status
Identification of important features through visualizations
Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing steps performed on the dataset include:

Handling missing values using imputation techniques
Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding
Scaling numerical features using MinMaxScaler


## Model Selection
Models chosen for the project include:

Decision Tree Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
XGBoost Classifier
Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation techniques such as cross-validation were used to select the best-performing models.

## Model Performance
Model performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and log loss. Feature importance analysis was also conducted to identify the most influential features in predicting survival.

## Results
The results of model predictions on the evaluation dataset were saved in CSV format for submission to a competition or further analysis. Insights gained from the predictions were also discussed.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the effectiveness of the models was evaluated based on their performance metrics and feature importance analysis. Recommendations for future work, such as improving model performance or exploring additional features, were provided.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:

pandas


numpy


matplotlib


seaborn


scikit-learn


xgboost


## Instructions
To reproduce the results:


1)Download the SpaceShip dataset (train.csv and test.csv).


2)Run the provided Python code in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment.


3)Follow the instructions within the code for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.


4)Adjust hyperparameters or explore additional models as needed.


5)Save the final model predictions in CSV format for submission or analysis.
